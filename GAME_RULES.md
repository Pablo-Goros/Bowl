# The Bowl - Rules Document

## Prerequisites:

- Minimum players: 2
- Maximum players: ~14 (Not fixed, technically unlimited)
- Separate players into two teams with roughly the same number of participants in each team

## Pre-Game:

- Create a set of 3-5 words per player (More words = Longer game)
- Words must be THINGS or VERBS only

## Game:

The game is divided into three sections. Each section consists of multiple rounds where teams alternate taking 1-minute turns. The objective is to guess as many words as possible from the BOWL. The BOWL is passed between team members only when a word is guessed correctly. After each 1-minute round, the BOWL passes to the other team for their round. This continues until no words remain in the BOWL. Once no words remain in the BOWL, move to the next section.

**Note:** A round is the 1-minute turn given to each team member. A section determines what rules apply to how players can give clues during their round.

## Sections:

**Section 1: Explain with Words**

- Describe the word using other words
- No acting, no sounds, no pointing
- Cannot use the word itself or the word in other languages

**Section 2: One Word Only**

- You can only say ONE word as a clue
- Cannot use the word itself or the word in other languages

**Section 3: Charades**

- Use only body language and gestures
- No sounds or speaking allowed
- Can point to objects in the room if needed

## Scoring:

- 1 point per word guessed correctly
- Points accumulate across all rounds

## Winning:

- Team with the most total points after all three sections wins
- In case of a tie, play one final bonus round with remaining words

## Important:

- If at any moment during a round, a person makes filler noises such as "uh", "ummmm", or a long "hmmmm...", the round ends immediately and the BOWL passes to the other team
- One word means one word. Things like "Star Wars" or "Credit card" are two words, so they are not valid
